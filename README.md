This project explores four distinct algorithms—brute force, greedy, divide and conquer, and dynamic programming—to identify the path with the greatest sum in a triangular grid. By implementing each method, the project evaluates their performance in terms of execution time and accuracy, providing insights into the efficiency and applicability of various algorithmic strategies for solving pathfinding problems in triangular structures.
